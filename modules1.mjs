import uinjhvjhvhf,{a,b,d} from './modules2.mjs'

console.log(uinjhvjhvhf);//here we are importing from modules2.mjs file and we give a variable name to the variable that we are exporting from modules2.mjs.(any name can be given to the imported variable ).

console.log(a)//so here we should the call the imported variable by its original name as used in its parent module.This is nothing but an example of named export
console.log(b)
console.log(d)
